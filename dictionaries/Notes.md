`generate_index_word_list.py` uses these to remove words or phrases from indexing. 
You can create as many custom exclusion dictionaries as you want.

- `NLTK.txt` is from https://gist.github.com/sebleier/554280
- `ef_edu.txt` is from https://www.ef.edu/english-resources/english-vocabulary/top-3000-words/
- `ordinary.txt` is "ordinary" (non-indexable) words from the book Effect Oriented Programming, but it's a reasonable foundation.
